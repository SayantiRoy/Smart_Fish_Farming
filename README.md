# Smart_Fish_Farming
## The purpose of our project is :
To help people predict the best type of fish to be cultivated in the particular habitat depending on the environmental variables. To help people do efficient fish farming or fish culture.
Major problem in fish farming is the lack of availability of good-quality stock. To overcome this problem, ways have now been worked out to breed these fish in ponds using hormonal stimulation. This has ensured the supply of pure fish stock in desired quantities.
Methods: Using Data Visualization and Data Processing, Unsupervised Algorithms and analyze the clustering of unlabeled datasets by K Means Clustering Algorithm and Hierarchical. Finally, applying Logistic Regression to real- world problems
